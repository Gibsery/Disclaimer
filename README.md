If you’re interacting with me, please understand that I am neurodivergent.
I believe that being open about neurodivergence is important.
It promotes the normalization of those who think differently.
The world would be a better place if we embraced the cringe.

I am very delusional and I struggle with understanding what is real or not. Keep this in mind when talking to me.
Do not reality check me unless I ask you to!

Do not talk to me about my hyperfixations unless you’re genuinely interested in hearing about them!
I tend to ramble and I’m very passionate about these subjects.
Disinterest in my hyperfixations is extremely discouraging to me and I almost always take it personally.
If that concerns you, it might be best not to talk about these things at all.

Transphobes, homophobes, proshippers, racists, etc get shot on site
